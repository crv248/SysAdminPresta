# SysAdminPresta
Project in Symfony 5 that gets the users and products from an existing Prestashop environment using the api and in one hand it's created a login form with the users and in other hand making a dashboard to view a list of products.

To create the view in the dashboard we used the free template Gentelella (https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/gentelella).
