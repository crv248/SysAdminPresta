# SysAdminPresta
Symfony 5 project which retrieves user and product data from an existing PrestaShop environment through its API. This entails the creation of a login form for user authentication and a dashboard for viewing a list of products upon successful sign-in.

To create the view in the dashboard we used the free template Gentelella (https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/gentelella).
