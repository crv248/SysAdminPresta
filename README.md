# SysAdminPresta
Project in Symfony 5 that get users and products from an existing Prestashop environment using the api. Then, on one hand a login form has been created with the users and on the other hand a dashboard to view a list of products after sign in.

To create the view in the dashboard we used the free template Gentelella (https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/gentelella).
